# Telegram Bot API

This library was copied from Ivan Grishaev's Teleward: https://github.com/igrishaev/teleward and extended with some methods. I use it for my Telegram bots and wrap new methods when needed. 

The reason this library exists alongside with the other popular libraries is that they're not GraalVM-compilable. This library might be useful for you if you, like me, compile your Telegram bots to native images using GraalVM.
